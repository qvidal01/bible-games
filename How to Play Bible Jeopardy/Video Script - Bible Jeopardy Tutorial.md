## INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Show main page]**

"Welcome to Bible Jeopardy! This is a fun trivia game based on the classic TV show format, perfect for family worship, congregation events, or just practicing your Bible knowledge.

In this tutorial, I'll walk you through everything you need to know - from creating a game to using the special features that make hosting easier than ever.

Let's get started!"

---

## SECTION 1: MAIN MENU OPTIONS (0:30 - 1:15)

**[Show the four main options]**

"When you first open the game, you'll see four options:

**Create the Game** - Use this if you're the host and want to start a new game for others to join.

**Join with Code** - If someone gave you a room code or QR code, use this to join their game.

**Study Mode** - This is solo practice mode where you can answer questions by yourself.

**Browse Public Rooms** - Find and join games that other hosts have made public.

And right here in the How to Play section, you can click **Watch Tutorial** to play this video anytime."

---

## SECTION 2: CREATING A GAME (1:15 - 2:30)

**[Click Create, show the form]**

"Let's create a game. First, enter your name - this is how players will see you.

You can give your room a name, like 'Family Game Night' - this is optional but helpful.

If you want a private game, check the **Private Room** box. This means only people with your code can join.

Now click **Create Room**."

**[Show lobby with room code]**

"You're now in the lobby! See this room code at the top? You can share it with players, or click **Show QR Code** for them to scan.

There's also a **Share** button to send the link directly.

**[Point to purple button]**

And hosts - see this purple **Projector View** button? We'll talk about that in a minute - it's great for TV displays and Zoom calls."

---

## SECTION 3: JOINING A GAME (2:30 - 3:00)

**[Go back, show Join flow]**

"If you're a player joining someone else's game, click **Join with Code**.

Enter the 6-character room code or scan the QR code.

Type your name and you're in! You'll wait in the lobby until the host starts the game."

---

## SECTION 4: SELECTING CATEGORIES & STARTING (3:00 - 3:45)

**[Show category selection]**

"Back to hosting - once your players have joined, click **Select Categories**.

You'll see 20 different Bible topics. Pick exactly 5 categories for your game. Can't decide? Hit the **Random** button!

Once you've selected 5, the **Start Game** button activates. Click it and let's play!"

---

## SECTION 5: GAMEPLAY - THE BOARD (3:45 - 4:30)

**[Show game board]**

"Here's your Jeopardy board! Five categories across the top, with point values from $200 to $1000.

On the right, you can see everyone's scores.

As the host, click any dollar value to reveal a question."

**[Click a question]**

"The question appears on everyone's screen. Players tap the **BUZZ** button when they know the answer - first one to buzz gets to answer!

The player has 15 seconds to respond out loud."

---

## SECTION 6: HOST ANSWER CONTROLS - NEW! (4:30 - 5:30)

**[Show the host controls on a question]**

"Now here's one of the best features for hosts - **private answer viewing**.

When a player buzzes in and answers, you have three options:

If you know they're right - tap **Correct** to add points.
If you know they're wrong - tap **Wrong** to subtract points.

But here's the key - if you're not sure, tap **View Answer - Host Only**.

**[Click View Answer]**

See how it says 'HOST ONLY VIEW' at the top? Only YOU can see this answer. Players on their phones or watching the TV will NOT see it.

This is perfect if you're sharing your screen on Zoom or have the game on a TV - you can check the answer without revealing it to everyone!

After viewing, you can:
- Mark it **Correct** or **Wrong**
- Click **Show Answer to All Players** if you want everyone to see it
- Or just close the question and move on"

---

## SECTION 7: PROJECTOR MODE - NEW! (5:30 - 6:15)

**[Click the Projector View button]**

"Let me show you **Projector Mode** - this is a game-changer for group settings.

Click the purple monitor icon or the **Projector View** button. A new tab opens with a clean display.

**[Show the projector view]**

This view is designed for TVs and projectors. It shows:
- The game board
- Questions when selected
- Player scores
- Who buzzed in

But it does NOT show:
- The host control buttons
- The answer (unless you click 'Show to All')

**For in-person games:** Put this view on your TV and control from your phone.

**For Zoom:** Share this browser tab on Zoom. Control the game from your phone or another window. Everyone sees a professional display, and only you can see the answers!

There's even a fullscreen button for the best TV experience."

## SECTION 8: SPECIAL FEATURES (6:15 - 6:45)

**[Show these features briefly]**

"A few more features to know about:

**Daily Doubles** - Hidden on the board! If you find one, wager your points before seeing the question.

**Double Jeopardy** - Round 2 has double point values.

**Final Jeopardy** - At the end, everyone wagers and writes their final answer.

**Pass the Baton** - If you need to leave, make another player the host."

---

## SECTION 9: WRAP UP (6:45 - 7:00)

**[Back to main screen]**

"That's everything you need to know! Remember:

- Hosts can view answers privately
- Use Projector Mode for TV or Zoom
- Have fun testing your Bible knowledge!

If you have feedback or find any issues, use the **Feedback** button at the bottom of the screen.

Thanks for watching, and enjoy Bible Jeopardy!"
