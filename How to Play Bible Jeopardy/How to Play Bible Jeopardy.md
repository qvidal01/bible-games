# How to Play Bible Jeopardy  
## 1.0 Welcome to Bible Jeopardy!  
Welcome! This guide will walk you through every step of playing Bible Jeopardy, from starting a new game to mastering the rules of play. Based on the classic trivia format, this game is a perfect and fun activity for family worship, congregation events, or even just practicing your Bible knowledge on your own.  
## 2.0 Getting Started: Your Four Options  
When you first launch the game, you'll see four main options. Here’s what each one does:  
* **Create the Game:** Use this if you are the host and want to start a new game for others to join.  
* **Join with Code:** Use this if you have a room code or QR code to join a game someone else has already created.  
* **Study Mode:** A solo practice mode where you can answer questions by yourself to sharpen your skills.  
* **Browse Public Rooms:** Look for and join games that hosts have made available for anyone to join.  
Now that you know your options, let's look at how to set up a game as the host.  
## 3.0 For the Host: Creating and Managing a Game  
This section is for the person who will be setting up and running the game for others.  
**3.1 Creating Your Game Room**  
Follow these simple steps to get your game room ready:  
1. **Enter Your Name:** Type in the name you want to be known as during the game.  
2. **Name the Room (Optional):** You can give your game room a unique name to make it easily identifiable for your players.  
3. **Set Privacy:** Choose the "private room" option. This ensures that no one can join unless you give them the specific room code.  
**3.2 Inviting Players**  
Once your private room is created, you can invite players using two easy methods:  
* Share the unique **Room Code**.  
* Share the scannable **QR Code**.  
**3.3 The Lobby: Assembling Your Players**  
After creating the room, you will land in the pre-game lobby. The host's name is always listed first. As other players use your code to join, their names will appear in the list. You can wait here until all your players have successfully joined before kicking things off.  
**3.4 Choosing Categories & Starting the Game**  
Before the fun can begin, you need to complete two final steps:  
1. **Select Categories:** The host must choose exactly five categories for the game from a pool of 20. You can mix and match your favorite topics or use the "random selection" button for a fun surprise!  
2. **Start Game:** The "Start Game" button will only become active *after* five categories have been selected. Press it to begin!  
With the game set up, let's cover how other participants can get in on the fun.  
## 4.0 For Players: How to Join a Game  
Joining a game created by a host is quick and easy.  
1. Select the **Join with Code** option from the main menu.  
2. Enter the room code provided by the host, or scan the QR code using your device.  
3. Enter your name when prompted. You will then be placed in the game lobby to wait for the host to start.  
Once everyone is in the lobby and the host has started the game, you'll see the main game board.  
## 5.0 The Main Event: How to Play  
Ready for the main event? Here’s everything you need to know to navigate the game board and rack up points!  
**5.1 Understanding the Game Screen**  
Here are the key elements you'll see on the main game screen:  

| Element | Description |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Game Board | The classic grid showing the 5 categories and clues with increasing point values. |
| Player Scores | A list of all players and their current point totals. |
| Host Controls | At the top, the host has unique buttons: "Pass the Baton" and "End Game". |
| Invite Players | On the right side, there is an option to invite more players even after the game starts. |
  
**5.2 Gameplay Flow: From Clue to Answer**  
Each turn follows a clear sequence of events, with the host managing the points.  
1. The player with control of the board selects a category and point value.  
2. The question appears on everyone's screen, and a "buzz" button becomes available to all players.  
3. The first player to press the "buzz" button gets the chance to answer. Everyone is notified who buzzed in, and a **15-second** timer begins.  
4. The host judges the answer:  
    * **If correct:** The host marks it as correct, and the points are added to the player's score. That player now has control of the board.  
    * **If incorrect:** The host marks it as incorrect, and the points are deducted from the player's score. The question remains open for other players to buzz in and attempt to answer.  
**5.3 Who's Turn Is It?**  
Control of the game board—meaning who gets to pick the next clue—is key to winning! Here's how it works:  
* The host determines which player or team starts the game.  
* After a correct answer, the player who answered correctly selects the next clue.  
* After an incorrect answer, if another player buzzes in and is correct, that new player selects the next clue.  
* If no one answers a clue correctly, control of the board returns to the player who made the last correct selection.  
## 6.0 Game Modes & Special Features  
Bible Jeopardy is more than just a quiz; it’s packed with features from the classic TV show to make every game exciting and unique.  
* **Individual Play:** For 2-5 players, where everyone competes against each other.  
* **Team Play:** Allows for up to 3 teams, with up to 5 players each, to compete.  
* **Study Mode:** A solo mode for practicing questions on your own.  
* **Spectators:** Up to 10 people can join a room just to watch the game without playing.  
* **Daily Doubles:** Watch out for these hidden clues! If you find one, you can wager any amount of your current points before the question is revealed. A correct answer adds your wager to your score, but an incorrect answer deducts it!  
* **Final Jeopardy:** The ultimate test of knowledge! In the final round, a single category is revealed. All players secretly wager a portion of their points and then have time to write down their answer to the final question.  
* **Pass the Baton:** If a host needs to leave, they can use this button to make another player the new host. **Important:** When a player becomes the host, their points become invalid.  
## 7.0 Finishing the Game  
The game concludes when the host presses the **End Game** button. This will end the session for all participants and return everyone to the main screen.  
## 8.0 Good to Know  
Here are a few final tips to keep in mind:  
* Remember the **15-second time limit** to answer after you buzz in!  
* If you encounter any issues or have ideas, use the **Feedback** button at the bottom of the screen to report a bug, suggest improvements, or rate your experience.
